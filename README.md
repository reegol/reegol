- 👋 Hi, I’m @reegol
- 👀 I’m interested in the use of MIMIC databases
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data extraction
- 💞️ this is graduate product of my classmate (https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9957563)，Although she didn't use the mimic database, I was interested in the database

Here's some of the articles I've read:
1.Machine learning for the prediction of acute kidney injury in patients with sepsis;
2.SAPS III is superior to SOFA for predicting 28-day mortality in sepsis patients based on Sepsis 3.0 criteria
3.A machine learning-based risk stratification tool for in-hospital mortality of intensive care unit patients with heart failure
4.Predicting renal function recovery and short-term reversibility among acute kidney injury patients in the ICU: comparison of machine learning methods and conventional regression
5.Application of interpretable machine learning for early prediction of prognosis in acute kidney injury
etc.
